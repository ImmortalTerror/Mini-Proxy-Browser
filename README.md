# Mini Proxy Browser

## Overview
This is a program which uses [MiniProxy](https://ersupport.com/plugins/QuickWebProxy/miniProxy.php) to access websites that may be blocked by your router.
This started off as a small project that i would work on at school when i had free time. I begun to really like it so I put some more effort into it and added it to Github :)
I know there are better ways to access blocked sites but i wanted to make this just for the learning experience.

## Future plans
- Right now, I have it so the program will open a link with Chrome even if its not your default browser. This is because on the school pc's at my school, chrome would never be the default browser and it was just a pain to set it to your default every time you logged on. So i made it use chrome even if ie or whatever was your default browser. I plan to make a 2nd version which uses your default browser.
- Other shit I'll think of later.
